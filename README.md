Extracts files embedded in Microsoft Office documents

Microsoft Office documents like Word, Excel and such allow to embed other files like PDF, pictures or again office files.

The content of such files can be extracted into a folder structure by handling them like ZIP files.

To just extract embedded files without extracting the whole document structure I wrote this script.
